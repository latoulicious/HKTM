So hear me out

instead im pushing the boundary if discord embed , im gonna scale down. so instead detailed stats im just showing their respective skills i.e from support hint or event skills

so we leveraging the {build_id}/support.json as core endpoint , and use the {slug_id} for populating the image later on

when user invoke the command either using name or the full slug/url_name we return what available skills that support card had

from what we have right now the gametora_client.go

we simplify the details needed for embed , right now the plan was to cram every single details inside embed which quite complex since its pushing the discord embed to the limit without hack around

we keep the newgametoraclient , get build id function , search support card , get support card image and revamp the caching mechanism

here the core endpoint

https://gametora.com/_next/data/4Lod4e9rq2HCjy-VKjMHJ/umamusume/supports.json ( this one is the core endpoint consist of every single skill data etc, check the sample.json ) 

https://gametora.com/_next/data/4Lod4e9rq2HCjy-VKjMHJ/umamusume/characters/daring-tact.json?id=daring-tact ( this one for fetching the card metadata or check the metadata.json ) or https://gametora.com/_next/data/Yc0z5VqNnvNNtiPlBZavp/umamusume/supports/30261-win-variation.json?id=30261-win-variation ( totally the same return res )

https://gametora.com/images/umamusume/supports/tex_support_card_{slug_id}.png ( this one for the image grabber based on the slug id ) or https://gametora.com/images/umamusume/supports/tex_support_card_10001.png ( the example from the website )

now for the proposed embed struct

right now its defined as such
