> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This project is developed for personal use in a private Discord server. While the code is open-source for educational purposes, it is **not** production-ready and may lack general support or stability guarantees.


## Features

- **Direct Audio Pipeline** — `yt-dlp → FFmpeg → gopus` for full transparency
- **No DCA Dependency** — Avoids DCA’s silent failures and black-box behavior
- **Stream-First Design** — Built for low-latency, stable audio playback
- **Battle-Tested Tools** — Leverages mature tools (FFmpeg, yt-dlp) instead of wrappers


## Architecture

The audio streaming flow is purpose-built for performance and clarity:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[yt-dlp] --> B[FFmpeg (PCM)]
  B ----------> C[gopus (Opus Encoder)]
  C ----------> D[Discord Voice Channel]
```

### Pipeline Breakdown:

1. **yt-dlp** – Extracts direct audio stream URLs from YouTube.
2. **FFmpeg** – Converts audio to raw PCM format (`48kHz`, `16-bit`, `stereo`).
3. **gopus** – Encodes PCM to Opus (optimized for Discord).
4. **Discord** – Streams Opus frames to voice channels via Discord Gateway.


## Why This Approach?

- **Full Pipeline Control** – Know exactly what’s happening at each stage
- **Zero Black Boxes** – Easier to debug and extend than DCA-based solutions
- **Granular Error Recovery** – Handle broken pipes, subprocess failures, etc.
- **Pure Go Integration** – `gopus` enables native Opus encoding

## Requirements

Make sure the following are installed and available in your `PATH`:

- [Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/latoulicious/Tarumae.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository
```bash
cd Tarumae
```
3. Install the dependencies
```bash
go mod tidy
```
3. Configure your Discord bot token (via `.env`).
4. Run the bot:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go 

# or using makefile 

make run
```
> See the [Makefile](https://github.com/latoulicious/Tarumae/blob/main/Makefile) for more available commands.

## Known Issues

- Audio may **cut off abruptly after prolonged playback** — suspected stream or subprocess timeout. Currently under investigation.
